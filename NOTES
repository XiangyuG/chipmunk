# 3. Incremental search: Try a small grid. Then expand the grid and move on to
# larger and larger grids.
# Ans: This seems to work reasonably. It terminates quite
# quickly for grids of size up to 2 by 2.

# 4. Does Alvin's idea of removing constraints on the indicator variables
# actually reduce search time?
# Ans: For now, for small programs, the program spec isn't sufficiently
# constraining, so removing these constraints on the indicator variables causes
# us to generate spurious solutions, which increases search time. It's possible
# that for larger problems where the spec is larger, removing these indicator
# variable constraints doesn't lead to spurious solutions and speeds up search
# time.
