Original benchmark: about 20 to 40 seconds (very variable). (serial)
Reducing both opcode and salu config: 3 seconds on average. (serial)
slv-parallel: 4 to 5 seconds, but can't go beyond a single machine. (parallel)

Benchmark2:
Original (with slv-parallel): Killed after no result in 6.5 minutes. (parallel)
Reducing both opcode and salu config: 13 seconds or so (parallel)

Overall, domain-specific concretization of holes seems to help quite a bit. I
think this might be a good way to speed up synthesis.
