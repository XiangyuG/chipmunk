# 1. How do we handle addresses in stateful arrays? Maybe transform it to some
# kind of equivalent scalar stateful form?

# 2. Maybe use the Domino compiler as a bootstrap for this? In the sense that
# there is no point searching in a grid that's larger than the grid that the
# Domino compiler requires. Related to Domino as a bootstrap, write a simple
# translator to turn Domino code into a canonical form for Sketch.

# 3. Setup some benchmarking infrastructure.

# 4. Is there any way to track progress of sketch?

# 5. Maybe the full spec doesn't compile (or doesn't compile within a timeout).
# But some modification to the full spec causes it to compile (e.g., deleting a
# line of code).  Then we can see if we can take the modified spec's compiled
# output and "patch" it to get the full spec's compiled output.

# 6. Understand why "time python3 compile.py test.sk 4 5 yes" compiles, but
# "time python3 compile.py test.sk 5 5 yes" doesn't. Intuitively, you would
# expect successful compilation on a smaller grid to imply successful
# compilation on a larger grid.
