# 1. How do we handle addresses in stateful arrays? Maybe transform it to some
# kind of equivalent scalar stateful form?

# 2. Maybe use the Domino compiler as a bootstrap for this? In the sense that
# there is no point searching in a grid that's larger than the grid that the
# Domino compiler requires. Related to Domino as a bootstrap, write a simple
# translator to turn Domino code into a canonical form for Sketch.

# 3. Incremental search: Try a small grid. Then expand the grid and move on to
# larger and larger grids.: This seems to work reasonably. It terminates quite
# quickly for grids of size up to 2 by 2.

# 4. Does Alvin's idea of removing constraints on the indicator variables
# actually reduce search time?

# 5. Setup some benchmarking infrastructure.

# 6. Is there any way to track progress of sketch?

# 7. Maybe there is a way to specify that the packet fields and state variables
# will always be related in some ways to each other using assume statements.
# Because the state variables all start from some given initial value. THis
# might mean that they continue to be related?
