1. bnd-int-range and incompleteness/non-monotonicity. Do you actually ever use
bnd-int-range given that it can spuriously reject programs?
Ans: AFAIK and understand, the wrong bnd-int-range can lead to unsound results
(not just incomplete results):

4. Increasing bnd-int-range to 50 gets the 5*5 grid to map after a while (3
hours ten mins), but removing bnd-int-range entirely and running slv-parallel
fails. So does running sketch --slv-seed 1 --bnd-inbits=2 (i.e., not running it
in parallel). I don't understand why at all because I thought the default
bnd-int-range was more than 50. I think it's 8192 * 6 (the INTEGERBOUND
variable), but I am not sure. My results seem to suggest that the default
bnd-int-range might be less than 50, which is why not specifying it in either
the parallel or sequential case leads to things not resolving.
